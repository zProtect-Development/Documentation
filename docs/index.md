## FAQ
### What is the difference between a commercial license and a non-commercial license?
A non-commercial license has licensing limits that disallow the use of the zProtect obfuscator on any software that you intend to distribute commercially (i.e. for monetary gain). However, a commercial license lifts these limits, and allows you to use the zProtect obfuscator on any software.

### How do I remove the watermark?
A commercial license is required to unlock the option to remove the watermark. This behavior is intentional.

### I currently have a non-commercial license. How do I upgrade to a commercial license?
At the moment, it is not possible to upgrade to a commercial license from a non-commercial license on the web interface. Please contact zProtect support to discuss your options.

[^1]: Guarunteed support for Kotlin™ and Java™. Other JVM languages are supported on a best effort basis.
